# Sublime Text API Stubs

With LSP proper configured, you can have something like the following screenshot.

![LSP and pyright](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfcherng-sublime/ST-api-stubs/master/docs/with-pyright.png)

You can also use these stub files to make [mypy][gh-mypy] work better with your plugins.

## How to Use

I personally use this with [LSP][pc-lsp] + [LSP-pyright][pc-lsp-pyright] setup.

1. Install the [LSP][pc-lsp] package via Package Control.
1. You have to copy `typings/` from this repository to `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/typings/` directory.
   Some people may be used to call it `stubs/`. In that case, you just have to also change all
   those `typings/` in following settings in this section.
1. Make your preferred LSP server able to "see" them.

   - If you use [LSP-pyright][pc-lsp-pyright], configure the `python.analysis.extraPaths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../typings",
             ],
             // a special predefined setup for developing ST plugins
             "pyright.dev_environment": "sublime_text",
         },
     }
     ```

   - If you use [LSP-pylsp][pc-lsp-pylsp], configure the `pylsp.plugins.jedi.extra_paths`:

     ```js
     {
         "settings": {
             "pylsp.plugins.jedi.extra_paths": [
                 // project's stubs
                 "$folder/typings",
                 // my custom stubs
                 "$packages/../typings",
             ],
         },
     }
     ```

1. Restart your ST and happy coding â™¥
