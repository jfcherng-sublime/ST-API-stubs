## What are These `.py` Files for

In order to have type annotations, those stub files in this repository are maintained manually.

Thus, we need a way to know what's the current version of stubs and know what are differences
between the current version and the next version. These `.py` files are the current version of
implementations which can be used to `diff` with the next version to find out changes quickly.
